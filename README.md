# Sparse question answering

## Solr
We want to use Apache Solr for indexing and queries.
It is described in [README](solr/README.md)

## Streamlit
We target to create simple UI with streamlit.

## Setup
Use
```bash
docker-compose up [-d]
```
and enjoy!
Streamlit will run on http://localhost:80 or http://0.0.0.0:80.
You can also use Apache Solr UI at http://localhost:8983 or http://0.0.0.0:8983.
